## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17+` or above installed and NodeJS `18`.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SeeQLancer.

4. Setup local PostgreSQL instance and change `server/src/main/application.properties` to match your DB configuration.

5. Build fronend and backend
```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
cd server
mvn clean package -DskipTests
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

6. Run backend
```bash
cd server
java -jar target/server-1.0.0.jar
```

7. Run frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

8. Navigating to the local host URL(E.g. http://localhost:3000) should bring up this webage.
